Feature: Matrices

Scenario: Constructing and inspecting a 4x4 matrix
  Given the following 4x4 matrix M:
  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
  | 5.5 | 6.5 | 7.5 | 8.5 |
  |  9  | 10  | 11  | 12  |
  |13.5 |14.5 |15.5 |16.5 |
  Then M[0,0] = 1.0
    And M[0,3] = 4.0
    And M[1,0] = 5.5
    And M[1,2] = 7.5
    And M[2,2] = 11.0
    And M[3,0] = 13.5
    And M[3,2] = 15.5

Scenario: A 2x2 matrix ought to be representable
  Given the following 2x2 matrix M:
  | -3  |  5  |
  |  1  | -2  |
  Then M[0,0] = -3.0
  And M[0,1] = 5.0
  And M[1,0] = 1.0
  And M[1,1] = -2.0

Scenario: A 3x3 matrix ought to be representable
  Given the following 3x3 matrix M:
  | -3  |  5  |  0  |
  |  1  | -2  | -7  |
  |  0  |  1  |  1  |
  Then M[0,0] = -3.0
  And M[1,1] = -2.0
  And M[2,2] = 1.0

Scenario: Matrix equality with identical matrices
  Given the following matrix A:
    |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
    |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |
    |  9  |  8  |  7  |  6  |
    |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |
  And the following matrix B:
    |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
    |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |
    |  9  |  8  |  7  |  6  |
    |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |
  Then A = B

Scenario: Matrix equality with different matrices
  Given the following matrix A:
    |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
    |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |
    |  9  |  8  |  7  |  6  |
    |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |
  And the following matrix B:
    |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |
    |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
    |  8  |  7  |  6  |  5  |
    |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |
  Then A != B
